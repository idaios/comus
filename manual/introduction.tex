The multi-species coalescent model allows for the simultaneous simulation of samples that belong to more than one species. 

We present the software \comus that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item can simulate polymorphic data, as well as DNA and Protein sequences from several species.
\item implements both the infinite and the finite site model.
\item allows for complex demographic scenarios within each species.
\item allows for gradual isolation of species after a speciation event. 
\end{enumerate}

\comus is developed in C programming language and is available as an open-source software under the GPLv3.0 license.
